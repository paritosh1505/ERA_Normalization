# Code Repository

This repository contains code for a deep learning model using PyTorch. The code is divided into multiple files and provides functionality for training and evaluating the model.

## Code 1: Model Definition

File: `model.py`

This file contains the definition of the neural network model `Net` class. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and normalization layers. The choice of normalization (batch normalization or group normalization) can be specified using the `norm_value` parameter.

The `forward` method defines the forward pass of the model. The `get_norm_layer` method is used to select the appropriate normalization layer based on the given `norm_value`.

The `model_summary` function can be used to print a summary of the model architecture and the size of the input.

## Code 2: Helper Functions and Data Loading

File: `helpers.py`

This file contains various helper functions for data loading, visualization, and augmentation.

The `load_data` function loads the CIFAR-10 dataset and applies data transformations using the Albumentations library for image augmentation. It returns the train and test data loaders.

The `plotings` class provides a method for plotting images from the dataset.

## Code 3: Training and Evaluation

File: `performance.py`

This file contains the `Performance` class, which is responsible for training and evaluating the model.

The `train` method performs the training loop, iterating over the train data loader, calculating the loss, and updating the model parameters using backpropagation. It also supports L1 regularization.

The `test` method evaluates the trained model on the test data and calculates the accuracy and loss.

The `scores` function returns the training and testing loss and accuracy values.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Modify the parameters in the `main.py` file as needed.

3. Run the `main.py` script to train and evaluate the model.
